I find myself uttering this in my current 9-5 job. I am constantly in data, analyzing it day over day with old school methods (yeah I just called excel old school). I thought back through my time at college and remembered a VB.net programming class - I was building websites, databases, algorithims. Things that I could be spending time developing to increase my productivity in my current job permanently. This was a huge passion of mine in college, but something I let slide away.

I am most excited to learn to be a software engineer to not only build websites and software that looks and feels cool, but to make the lives of people in the future version of my current job easier.
